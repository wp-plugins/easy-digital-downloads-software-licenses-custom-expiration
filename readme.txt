Define a different license expiration for downloads assigned to a specific Bundle. Requires the EDD Software Licensing Addon

== Description ==

By default, any EDD Download Bundle containing multiple EDD Downloads will generate a single license key based on the
expiration set on the individual EDD Downloads.  However, if you want to offer a different expiration on this single
license key, Easy Digital Downloads Software Licensing addon does not provide a way to do this.

This plugin adds an option to your Bundled Downloads in the WordPress Administration, allowing you to optionally
specify a different expiration period.

When a customer then purchases your Bundle, the download(s) in that Bundle will have license keys with your custom
expiry date.

This does not effect customers when purchasing a single download; they will still get a license key which expires per
the Easy Digital Downloads: Software Licensing addon.
